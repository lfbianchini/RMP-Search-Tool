done: 
    method to find university and professor id
need to do:
    method to query to the page of the professor eg https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor/517854
        this should be super light bcs we're just adding on an id to the query string
        we should have it return it as a string for now
    method to scrape all grades found in the reviews
        need to watch out for reviews that don't have any grades posted
    method to scrape all written reviews
        probably just return it as an arraylist for now
    method to find all unique classes in a professor's reviews
        would be a little hard just bcs user inconsistency for class names but we'll see 
        also would be nice to have it return a hashmap where the keys r the classes and the 
        vals r the avg grades, we'll see tho if not its fine
    method that uses gpt api to summarize the written reviews

    then we have to do UI 
        if its too hard we could just have it as a console program but ui would be insane
    after ui is done with all parts above integrated we could also use postgreSQL and have our own database for
    user logins and maybe even search history but this is only if everything else came super easy and we have time/
    motivation for it

    let me know if theres anything else we could do or if im missing out on something
